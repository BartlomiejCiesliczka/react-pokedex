        I created Pokedex for every Pokemon lover :D
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
        In the "Pokedex" section, you will find a list of all available Pokemon.
        After clicking on the tile or searching using the Searchbar specific
        Pokemon, you will see data of the selected creature. The "Types" section
        is a list, when clicked in the selected item you will see a list with
        pokemons of that type. To get the Pokemons data it was used the Pok√©API.

        The main goal with this project was to learn React and library like MUI,
        Router, Redux, Query etc.
