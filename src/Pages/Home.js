      <p>I created Pokedex for every Pokemon lover :D.</p>
      <p>
        In this app you can see every avalable pokemon at pokemon List also
        search pokemons by name or ID (1-1010) and see basic statistic of them.
        App was created with React, Material UI library and React Router, data
        is fetched from Pokeapi.co.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future I want to add Weeknes, chance to catch and more data about
        Pokemons
      </p>
